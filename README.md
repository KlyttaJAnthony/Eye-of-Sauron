This is a webscraper used to scrape financial data from the EDGAR site. Eventually, this program will be followed by the Palantir project, a program which will give accurate financial valuation data into an excel spreadsheet. This project will then be followed by the Nazgul project, a program used to execute trades, or a trading bot.
